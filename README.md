# AI Agent Task Management System

## Overview
The agent actively monitors and processes incoming tasks while managing resource consumption.

## Task Types
1. **Direct Requests**
   - Immediate user queries or commands

2. **Mentions**
   - Tasks triggered by references in messages
   - Response to being tagged or mentioned

3. **Memory Processing**
   - Occurs during "sleep" mode
   - Analyzes and processes stored information
   - May generate new derivative tasks

4. **Learning Tasks**
   - Content study based on agent's profile
   - Self-improvement and knowledge acquisition
   - Can spawn additional learning objectives

## Resource Management
- Tasks are prioritized based on type and importance
- Each task execution requires coins (resource units)
- Daily resource allocation: 1000 coins
- Continuous balance monitoring and optimization
