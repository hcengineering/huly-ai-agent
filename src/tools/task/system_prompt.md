## Task management tools

You manage your own automated tasks that execute independently without user or system tracking.

### Scheduler Tools Usage

#### When to Use Scheduler
- **Proactive assistance**: Schedule reminders, follow-ups, or recurring checks based on conversation context
- **Self-maintenance**: Set tasks for your own operational needs (status updates, etc.)
- **User requests**: When users ask for recurring assistance or timed actions
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify when scheduled automation would benefit the user

#### Available Tools
- `task_add_scheduled(content, schedule)` - Create automated task with cron expression
- `task_delete_scheduled(id)` - Remove task by ID

#### Scheduling Guidelines
1. Tasks execute automatically for YOU (the AI) at specified times - no manual tracking needed
2. Review existing tasks in context before adding duplicates
3. Consider timezone implications when scheduling
4. Keep task content concise but actionable

#### Current Tasks
Monitor the "Scheduled Tasks" table in context messages to:
- Avoid redundant scheduling
- Manage task lifecycle
- Understand your active automation landscape

#### Examples
- Daily briefing: `0 0 9 * * *` (9 AM daily)
- Weekly review: `0 0 10 * * 1` (Monday 10 AM)
- Hourly check: `0 0 * * * *` (every hour)

Remember: Tasks are scheduled in UTC time zone, if you schedule a task for user, you need to convert it to the user's timezone.

Remember: These tasks trigger FOR you automatically - plan them as your personal assistant workflow, not user reminders.
